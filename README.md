Junit-testing, a schoolproject.

The project uses the JUnit 5 testing framework and AssertJ for assertions. The tests are designed to be descriptive and self-explanatory, with each test case having a descriptive name explaining what it is testing.<br/>
<b>Github action, build and test after push.</b>


<ul><li>Assignment 1:</li></ul>

Write <b>unit tests</b> for the classes Employee and Employees so that we get 100% code coverage. The interfaces BankService and EmployeeRepository are not available when we run the tests, so these need to be <b>implemented as test doubles. (Stub and Spy objects)</b> At least one of the tests should use <b>mockito to create test doubles</b> and at least one should use your own implementation that is placed in the test folder. Create a github action that automatically builds the code and runs all the tests when a push happens to the main branch.

<ul><li>Assignment 2:</li></ul>
Implement the following tasks using <b>Testdriven Development</b>. After each test with the corresponding code, a new commit should be created. Work in your own branch called uppgift2 and merge it into the main branch when the work is done.
